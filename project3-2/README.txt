1) Spatial Index:
After creating tables like in project2, you need to use “mysql CS144 < buildSQLIndex.sql” to create spatial table.

2) We develop basic and spatial search algorithms and XML convert method via Java. All you need to do is run “ant run” to get the results of test cases specified in AuctionSearchTest.java
