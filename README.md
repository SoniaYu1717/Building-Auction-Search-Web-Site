# Building-Auction-Search-Web-Site
In this poject, we built a mini eBay auction search web site. It includes five small projects and we can briefly summazrize them as:

First, we designed relational schema for eBay data in XML files and parsed them into MySQL load files in Java.

Then, we built a Web service with Apache Tomcat and Axis2 for the interface and Apache Lucene for inverted index.

Finally, we established a website for users to search items by integrating Web service, Google Map and suggest service.

Moreover, we utilized Spark engine to perform a potential computational task on machines with Map-Reduce framework.
